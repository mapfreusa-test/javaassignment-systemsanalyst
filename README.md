# Java Assignment - Systems Analyst

### Problem Statement
 
 ```
 Create a JAVA Spring Restful API project to implement a queue. The API should accept POST requests for enqueue and dequeue and a GET request to get the current size of the queue.
  * Enqueue will add elements to the queue.
  * dequeue will delete elements from the queue.
  * size will get the current size of the queue.
 ```
 ### Assumptions that can be made
 
 > Use an Array of ints of size 10 (you can use a bigger size if preferred) to represent your queue.
 
 ### What the solution should look like
 
 > A working program uploaded to github account(or any public git based repo) with a README file showing us how to run the program( any DB related scripts/tools that needs to be installed) and any additional comments/assumptions that have been made in the solution provided by you.
 
 > Working solution needs to have the following
 > * Needs to run without any errors.
 > * Good Unit Tests.
 > * Good Integration Tests.
 > * Proper Comments.
 > * Proper Exception/Error Handling Scenarios.
 
 #### Tips
 
 * A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

 #### Bonus Points
 
 * Use a database table instead of a java array as the queue store. You can use any database of your choice.
 
```
Good Luck
